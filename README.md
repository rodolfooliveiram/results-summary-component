## My process

My process to develop the solution for this challenge was first defining the HTML structure of the component and filling out the elements with static content.

Second I started to transform the style guide for the project into css styles.

Then considering that in a real project this component would be a parte of a more complete app with more other components that would be propably sharing common styles, I separated the css code in threes categories: utilities, for general css styles like fonts and colors that could be applied to all the app; global, basically for reseting default styles of HTML elements; and component, for specific styles to be applied to the component.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
